# Universal App

An app for one of my coding challenges.

It does following:

- fetches list of movies from a server in a background
- parses JSON
- uses MVVM architecture to present movies in the TableView and A detail View
- has plenty of ui constraints to work on various Apple devices


## Installation

- `git clone git@github.com:nadyapost/universal-app.git`
- `cd universal-app`

Open project in Xcode, run.
